Xsysroot is a tool that allows you to work with ARM images from your Intel computer.

It is specially useful to customize operating systems for micro computer boards
like the RaspberryPI, Beaglebone, Arduino Yun, and many more ARM-based processors.

Through its Python bindings, it allows to automate tasks like offline tests, releases, and software builds.

The latest online documentation can be found [here](http://xsysroot.mitako.eu/).
There is also a [pdf version](http://xsysroot.mitako.eu/xsysroot.pdf) for download.

Xsysroot is free software.
